</ol>

<h3>Multiplication Tables</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4>
<p>To display the multiples of a given number for 1 to 10.<p>
<h4>User Interaction:</h4>
<p>The user is prompted for an integer. The app then calculates the multiples of the supplied vairable for 1 through 10. The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>

<h3>Average Numbers</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4> 
<p>To display the average for a given sequence of numbers. The output includes a list of all numbers in the sequence and the average.</p>
<h4>User Interaction:</h4><p>The user is prompted with "How many numbers do you need to average?" The user is then prompted for each number in the sequence. The application then displays "The average of X, X, X is Z." Where each X represents each number in the sequence and Z represents the average of the sequence. The pattern will match whatever length of sequence is entered by the user, be it 2 or 2million numbers. The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>

<h3>Fizz Buzz</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4><p>The Fizz Buzz game. While counting from 1 to a set number, replace multiples of 3 with Fizz, multiples of 5 with Buzz, and multiples of both 3 and 5 with FizzBuzz.</p>
<h4>User Interaction:</h4><p>The user is prompted for the ending number of the Fizz Buzz game. The application then displays each number between 0 and the ending number, with the Fizz Buzz rules applied. Each number is displayed on a seperate line. The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>

<h3>Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4><p>To calculate the Fibonacci Sequence between 0 and a given number, exclusive of the given number.</p>
<h4>User Interaction:</h4><p>User is prompted for the ending number of the sequence. The app then displays the Fibonacci Sequence. The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>

<h2><a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> Challenges (Modified)</h2>
<h3>Sum Natural Multiple of 3 and 5</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4><p>Find the sum of all natural multiples of 3 and 5 within a range.</p>
<h3>User Interaction:</h3><p> The user is prompted for the ending number of the range. The app then displays "The sum of all natural multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and X is Z.," where X is the user supplied variable and Z is the sum. The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>

<h3>Sum of All Even Numbers In The Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4><p>Finds the sum of all numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence less than 4 million.</p>
<h3>User Interaction:</h3><p>The user is prompted "Do you want the full sequence or a subset?" The user enters either 1 (for the full sequence) or 2 (for a subset). For the full sequence, the application then displays the sum and the ending number. For the subset, the user is prompted for the ending number of the sequence. The application then displays the sum of the sequence and the ending number.<em>NOTE:</em> The user can enter ANY number, up to the maximum DOUBLE data type value (1.7976931E+308). The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>

<h3>Prime Factors for a Number</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4><p>Find all prime factors for a given number.</p>
<h3>User Interaction:</h3><p>The user is prompted for a number. The app then displays whether the user variable is prime. If the number is not prime, all factors of the number are listed. For all numbers, the prime factors are then listed. The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>

<h3>UpWork Pay Calculator</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4><p>Calculate the user's pay based on pay history with UpWork and the expected pay for a specific project. Upwork takes a percentage of the pay for each job with the same client. The amount of UpWork's percentage is determined by total compensation from the employer. The initial $500 is rated at 80%, $500 - $9,999 is 90%, and over $10,000 is 95%. The app helps determine exactly how much pay the freelancer will receive.</p>
<h3>User Interaction:</h3><p>The user is prompted for the amount of pay from the specific job. The app then asks if the user has worked previously for the same client. If yes, the app prompts the user for their total previous pay from the client. The app displays the expected pay for the job. The user is prompted to press any key to continue and is returned to the main menu.</p>
